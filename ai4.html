                <h2 class="featurette-heading">History of AI</h2>
                <p1 class="lead">The concept of inanimate objects endowed with intelligence has been around since
                    ancient times. The Greek god Hephaestus was depicted in myths as forging robot-like servants out of
                    gold. Engineers in ancient Egypt built statues of gods animated by priests. Throughout the
                    centuries, thinkers from Aristotle to the 13th century Spanish theologian Ramon Llull to Ren√©
                    Descartes and Thomas Bayes used the tools and logic of their times to describe human thought
                    processes as symbols, laying the foundation for AI concepts such as general knowledge
                    representation.</p1>
                <pre></pre>

                <p2 class="lead"> The late 19th and first half of the 20th centuries brought forth the foundational work
                    that would
                    give rise to the modern computer. In 1836, Cambridge University mathematician Charles Babbage and
                    Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace, invented the first design for a programmable machine. In
                    the 1940s, Princeton mathematician John Von Neumann conceived the architecture for the
                    stored-program computer -- the idea that a computer's program and the data it processes can be kept
                    in the computer's memory. And Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts laid the foundation for neural
                    networks.</p2>
                <pre></pre>

                <p3 class="lead">With the advent of modern computers, scientists could test their ideas about machine
                    intelligence.
                    One method for determining whether a computer has intelligence was devised by the British
                    mathematician and World War II code-breaker Alan Turing in 1950. The Turing Test focused on a
                    computer's ability to fool interrogators into believing its responses to their questions were made
                    by a human being.</p3>
                <pre></pre>

                <p4 class="lead">The modern field of artificial intelligence is widely cited as starting in 1956 during
                    a summer
                    conference at Dartmouth College. Sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),
                    the conference was attended by 10 luminaries in the field, including AI pioneers Marvin Minsky,
                    Oliver Selfridge and John McCarthy, who is credited with coining the term artificial intelligence.
                    Also in attendance were Allen Newell, a computer scientist, and Herbert A. Simon, an economist,
                    political scientist and cognitive psychologist, who presented their groundbreaking Logic Theorist, a
                    computer program capable of proving certain mathematical theorems and referred to as the first AI
                    program.</p4>
                <pre></pre>

                <p5 class="lead">In the wake of the Dartmouth College conference, leaders in the fledgling field of AI
                    predicted that
                    a man-made intelligence equivalent to the human brain was around the corner, attracting major
                    government and industry support. Indeed, nearly 20 years of well-funded basic research generated
                    significant advances in AI: For example, in the late 1950s, Newell and Simon published the General
                    Problem Solver (GPS) algorithm, which fell short of solving complex problems but laid the
                    foundations for developing more sophisticated cognitive architectures; McCarthy developed Lisp, a
                    language for AI programming that is still used today. In the mid-1960s MIT Professor Joseph
                    Weizenbaum developed ELIZA, an early natural language processing program that laid the foundation
                    for today's chatbots.</p5>
                <pre></pre>

                <p6 class="lead">But the achievement of artificial general intelligence proved elusive, not imminent,
                    hampered by
                    limitations in computer processing and memory and by the complexity of the problem. Government and
                    corporations backed away from their support of AI research, leading to a fallow period lasting from
                    1974 to 1980 and known as the first "AI Winter." In the 1980s, research on deep learning techniques
                    and industry's adoption of Edward Feigenbaum's expert systems sparked a new wave of AI enthusiasm,
                    only to be followed by another collapse of government funding and industry support. The second AI
                    winter lasted until the mid-1990s..</p5>

                <p1 class="lead">
                    AI and machine learning are at the top of the buzzword list security vendors use today to
                    differentiate their offerings. Those terms also represent truly viable technologies. Artificial
                    intelligence and machine learning in cybersecurity products are adding real value for security teams
                    looking for ways to identify attacks, malware and other threats.
                </p1>
                <pre></pre>
                <p2 class="lead"> Organizations use machine learning in security information and event management (SIEM)
                    software and related areas to detect anomalies and identify suspicious activities that indicate
                    threats. By analyzing data and using logic to identify similarities to known malicious code, AI can
                    provide alerts to new and emerging attacks much sooner than human employees and previous technology
                    iterations.</p2>
                <pre></pre>

                <p3 class="lead"> As a result, AI security technology both dramatically lowers the number of false
                    positives and gives organizations more time to counteract real threats before damage is done.
                    The maturing technology is playing a big role in helping organizations fight off cyberattacks.
