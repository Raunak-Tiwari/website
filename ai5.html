                <p1 class="lead"><b>AI in healthcare.</b> The biggest bets are on improving patient outcomes and
                    reducing
                    costs. Companies are applying machine learning to make better and faster diagnoses than humans. One
                    of the best-known healthcare technologies is IBM Watson. It understands natural language and can
                    respond to questions asked of it. The system mines patient data and other available data sources to
                    form a hypothesis, which it then presents with a confidence scoring schema. Other AI applications
                    include using online virtual health assistants and chatbots to help patients and healthcare
                    customers find medical information, schedule appointments, understand the billing process and
                    complete other administrative processes. An array of AI technologies is also being used to predict,
                    fight and understand pandemics such as COVID-19.</p1>
                <pre></pre>

                <p2 class="lead"> <b>AI in business.</b> Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics
                    and
                    customer relationship management (CRM) platforms to uncover information on how to better serve
                    customers. Chatbots have been incorporated into websites to provide immediate service to customers.
                    Automation of job positions has also become a talking point among academics and IT analysts.</p2>
                <pre></pre>

                <p3 class="lead"><b>AI in education.</b> AI can automate grading, giving educators more time. It can
                    assess
                    students and adapt to their needs, helping them work at their own pace. AI tutors can provide
                    additional support to students, ensuring they stay on track. And it could change where and how
                    students learn, perhaps even replacing some teachers.
                    AI in finance. AI in personal finance applications, such as Intuit Mint or TurboTax, is disrupting
                    financial institutions. Applications such as these collect personal data and provide financial
                    advice. Other programs, such as IBM Watson, have been applied to the process of buying a home.
                    Today, artificial intelligence software performs much of the trading on Wall Street.</p3>

                <p4 class="lead"><b>AI in law.</b> The discovery process -- sifting through documents -- in law is often
                    overwhelming for humans. Using AI to help automate the legal industry's labor-intensive processes is
                    saving time and improving client service. Law firms are using machine learning to describe data and
                    predict outcomes, computer vision to classify and extract information from documents and natural
                    language processing to interpret requests for information.</p4>

                <p6 class="lead"><b>AI in banking.</b> Banks are successfully employing chatbots to make their customers
                    aware
                    of services and offerings and to handle transactions that don't require human intervention. AI
                    virtual assistants are being used to improve and cut the costs of compliance with banking
                    regulations. Banking organizations are also using AI to improve their decision-making for loans, and
                    to set credit limits and identify investment opportunities.</p6>

                <p7 class="lead"><b>AI in transportation.</b> In addition to AI's fundamental role in operating
                    autonomous
                    vehicles, AI technologies are used in transportation to manage traffic, predict flight delays,
                    and make ocean shipping safer and more efficient.</p7>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Regulation of AI technology
                </h2>
                <p1 class="lead">
                    Despite potential risks, there are currently few regulations governing the use of AI tools, and
                    where laws do exist, they typically pertain to AI indirectly. For example, as previously mentioned,
                    United States Fair Lending regulations require financial institutions to explain credit decisions to
                    potential customers. This limits the extent to which lenders can use deep learning algorithms, which
                    by their nature are opaque and lack explainability.
                </p1>
                <pre></pre>

                <p2 class="lead"> The Europe Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) puts strict limits on how
                    enterprises can use consumer data, which impedes the training and functionality of many
                    consumer-facing AI applications.</p2>
                <pre></pre>

                <p3 class="lead">In October 2016, the National Science and Technology Council issued a report examining
                    the potential role governmental regulation might play in AI development, but it did not recommend
                    specific legislation be considered.
                </p3>
                <pre></pre>
                <p4 class="lead">Crafting laws to regulate AI will not be easy, in part because AI comprises a variety
                    of technologies that companies use for different ends, and partly because regulations can come at
                    the cost of AI progress and development. The rapid evolution of AI technologies is another obstacle
                    to forming meaningful regulation of AI. Technology breakthroughs and novel applications can make
                    existing laws instantly obsolete. For example, existing laws regulating the privacy of conversations
                    and recorded conversations do not cover the challenge posed by voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa
                    and Apple's Siri that gather but do not distribute conversation -- except to the companies'
                    technology teams which use it to improve machine learning algorithms. And, of course, the laws that
                    governments do manage to craft to regulate AI don't stop criminals from using the technology with
                    malicious intent.</p4>
